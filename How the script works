The following steps were taken in generating the tidy datase "Averages_dataset"
Reading the test and features datasets into r from the unzipped downloaded sensors data folder
Assigning features content as variable names to the test data
Merging and naming "subjects" and "activites" datasets for test with corresponding test dataset to obtain full_test_data
creating a "test" column to identify all data in file as "test" data
The same steps were repeated for training data to obtain the full_training_data
The full_test_data and full_ training data are then merged to obtain the full_dataset
After which, I subsetted for columns with mean and standard deviation, keeping the Subject_ID, activity and group columns
The resulting dataset is then grouped by "Subject_Id" and "activity" and summarised by getting average of each column for each group
variable names for the column averages for means and std are then edited to include "avg" meaning average
That is how I end up with the "Averages_dataset" at end of the script
